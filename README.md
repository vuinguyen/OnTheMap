# OnTheMap

This app pulls in student data from the Udacity server and displays the data in a tableview and a mapview. 

In order to get it to work, you need to do the following:

1. copy the APIKeysExample.swift file into the OnTheMap folder, rename it to APIKeys.swift, and then add the real application ID and REST API Key in the updated file

> cp APIKeysExample.swift OnTheMap/APIKeys.swift

Built for my class project, as part of the Udacity iOS nanodegree program.

FTW!
